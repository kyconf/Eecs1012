            <h2> My name is Kyle Fernandez</h2>

        <p> I am a first-year Computer Security student studying at York University. I come from the Philippines, and I love how everything is different here! </p>
    
        <p> <strong>EECS 1012 </strong> is a class that I will be taking. I am expecting to learn a lot, especially in the areas of web development and JavaScript. I realize that it will be hard
            but there is nothing that <u><strong>hard work and persistence</u></strong> cannot solve!
        </p>
            <hr>
        <p> These are my <strong>favorite hobbies</strong> to do!
            
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Playing the piano </li>
        <li> Swimming</li>
        <li> Playing badminton</li>
        <li> Building LEGOs</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <p> And, these are my favorite foods or dishes to eat back in the Philippines <u>(in order!)</u></p>
